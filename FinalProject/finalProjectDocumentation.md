### Final Project - Diver Game

I wanted to write this after I make my project fully work because I wanted to document the complete experience, but it still doesn't yet. Even though class is over, I am determined to keep working on it until I am satisfied.

##### Concept

I wasnted to build up on my midterm diver game with 3 main objectives 

1) make a control board with buttons
2) make an LED warning light 
3) make a more elaborate scoring system
4) make the game better visually

##### Process and Challenges 

I started out with 1) and 2) because I wanted to gove them highest priority.

I wired the circuit and started working on the code. The hardest part for me was serial communication and I spent a lot of time working out how it works in the context
of what I wanted to do. At first it seemed like the arduino worked, and I was happy with my work, but then the port disappeared again and I wasnt sure if I was doing something wrong or if the driver was just being weird. I worked on the code while it was working, but then had something that wasnt working but couldnt fix it because I couldnt run the code. All in all, I did what looked like it SHOULD work. I am definitely slightly disappointed because worrying about the Arduino took my mind off the actual project and I feel like I could have done better. 

I played around with the timer, and made it such that the score numbers are lower, but actually ended up prefeing how it was and reverting it back because I felt like the old version has more accuracy (there was a visible difference between playing the game for 10 seconds versus 15, which isnt that big of a difference but given the pace of the game I wanted to have a distinction). 

I wanted to arrange the buttons according to their direction ('top' button at the top, 'right' button on the right, etc) but after trying it I found out that there wasnt enough space on the breadboard for that arrangement and had to put all the buttons in a row and the LED on top (colour coded to the best of my ability witht the wires I had).

Serial communication was difficult for me to grasp. I actually prefer making things to coding things - I really like building. I find coding challenging but in a fun way. But I think that I now have a much better grasp on Arduino and learned a lot of fundamentals that I previously lacked. I think I learned a lot from this project a alone - especially about debugging :)

I ended up not adding any more visuals to the game because I was running out of time with the technical stuff. 

During the presengations today I felt a like I was behind everyone else because it seemed like everyone else's projects were a lot more elborate, but I think I am still proud of where I got given that I've had no prior experince with Processing (eventhough I learned about Arduino in Machine Lab). I like my game, but I just really want it to work.
